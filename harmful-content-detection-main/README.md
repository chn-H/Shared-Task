# Harmful Content Detection
## A GermEval 2025 Shared Task 

This repository contains the annotated Twitter dataset provided for the shared task in the context of GermEval 2025. The shared task is organised into the following three subtasks: 

1. The **binary detection** of so-called **call to actions**, i.e. calls for risky actions (e.g. criminal offences, demonstrations with possible escalation potential) 
2. The **fine-grained classification** into four forms of statements and (violent) attacks against the **free and democratic basic order** of the Federal Republic of Germany
3.  The **binary detection** of disturbing, **violence-related** statements in tweets

The provided data sets' main source is posts and comments from the public German-language Twitter network of a right-wing extremist group. These tweets were collected by members of Mittweida University of Applied Sciences from December 2020 to July 2016. In October 2024, four university members with a forensic background annotated each tweet. The final data sets for each subtask contain all tweets (between 9000 and 11,000) for which a majority decision of the four annotators could be made. 

The data sets for each subtask and further explanations of the data can be found in the repository's individual subdirectories.
